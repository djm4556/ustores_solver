# FOR NEW USERS: About KTANE and UltraStores
KTANE is a video game about communicating to defuse bombs with puzzles, where (usually) the
"defuser" sees the bomb but not the manual with solutions, and the "experts" see the manual
but not the bomb. As such, the word "bomb" will be used strictly in the context of KTANE.
Strict players may consider this solver to ruin the fun, but in my personal opinion, there
is no fun to be had with this module. It's extremely difficult for both the defuser and the
expert, and is partially viewable as a "cruel" version of the _already mind-bending_ "Simon
Stores" thanks to its usage of mechanics from "The Ultracube". Their manuals are below.

TL:DR The "bomb" is not real, and this _devil_ exists despite all reason, so I made this.
